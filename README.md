# **_Funny Dogs Memory Game_**


The Funny Dogs Memory Game is a simple matching cards game in which all the cards are flipped backside on a surface. 
There are 8 cards that have the same images, but each card is placed randomly, and the user's mission is to find them. It is possible to flip up with only two cards over each turn. 
The game doesn't have a time limit to find the pairs of cards.

Due to the low level of difficulty, the game is intended for younger users,to entertain and at the same time improve memory; however adults can also play it. 

Throughout the creation of this game, I was using three HTML ( index.html, welcome.html, instruction.html) two CSS files (game.css, style.css), and one java.js file.
