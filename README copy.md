In the game, there are 16 cards with funny illustrations of the dogs.
Due to the low level of difficulty, the game is intended for younger users, but adults can also play it. 
There are 8 cards that have the same images, but each card is placed randomly, and the user's mission is to find them. The game doesn't have a time limit to find the pairs of cards.
