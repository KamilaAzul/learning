        <h2>The memory game starts with all the cards face down.
            <br>
            A player takes turns to turn over two cards. If the cards do not match, it is not a pair and the cards will turn back over.
            If the two cards match, it is a pair!
            <br>
            The cards will stay uncovered and you can continue to play and search for other matches.
            Remember the cards' position and collect all the pairs as fast as possible.
            <br> 
            When you find all the pairs, the game is over.
